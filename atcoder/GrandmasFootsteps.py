Problem Statement
Takahashi is enjoying a game at school. The game starts at the moment the bell rings.

Immediately after the bell rings, he repeats the following actions:

Run at a speed of
S meters per second for
A seconds. Then, remain stationary for
B seconds.
How many meters in total does he run by the time
X seconds have elapsed since the bell rang?

Constraints
1≤S≤15
1≤A≤1000
1≤B≤1000
1≤X≤1000
All input values are integers.
Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

S
A
B
X
Output
Output the answer in one line. Omit the unit (meters) in the output.

Sample Input 1
Copy
7 3 2 11
Sample Output 1
Copy
49
During the
11 seconds after the bell rings, Takahashi moves as follows:

From
0 seconds to
3 seconds, he runs at a speed of
7 meters per second. The distance traveled during this time is
21 meters.
From
3 seconds to
5 seconds, he remains stationary.
From
5 seconds to
8 seconds, he runs at a speed of
7 meters per second. The distance traveled during this time is
21 meters.
From
8 seconds to
10 seconds, he remains stationary.
From
10 seconds to
11 seconds, he runs at a speed of
7 meters per second. The distance traveled during this time is
7 meters.
The total distance traveled is
49 meters, so output
49.

Sample Input 2
Copy
6 3 2 9
Sample Output 2
Copy
36
During the
9 seconds after the bell rings, Takahashi moves as follows:

From
0 seconds to
3 seconds, he runs at a speed of
6 meters per second. The distance traveled during this time is
18 meters.
From
3 seconds to
5 seconds, he remains stationary.
From
5 seconds to
8 seconds, he runs at a speed of
6 meters per second. The distance traveled during this time is
18 meters.
From
8 seconds to
9 seconds, he remains stationary.
The total distance traveled is
36 meters, so output
36.

Sample Input 3
Copy
1 1 666 428
Sample Output 3
Copy
1
During the
428 seconds after the bell rings, Takahashi moves as follows:

From
0 seconds to
1 second, he runs at a speed of
1 meter per second. The distance traveled during this time is
1 meter.
From
1 second to
428 seconds, he remains stationary.
The total distance traveled is
1 meter, so output
1.
